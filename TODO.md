hard

good to have
------------

 * snippets -> Readme, AutoFilePath -> Readme
 * error list has crude messages if a missing element of an object is selected

features
--------

 * filesGlob
 * tsserver
   + refactoring
   + formatting
 * multiple window fixes
 * build file live change (some utf error with autofilename)

DONE
====

 * no exceptions if tsconfig json error during init
 * tsconfig validation
 * is Build output working?
 * replace all print() with Debug('nofity')
 * Code-Completion. Replaced arguments are shitty
