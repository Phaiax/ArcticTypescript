Arctic Typescript:

Note for users which have used additional "" in the typescript settings to enclose paths that included spaces.

	Example:
		"output_dir_path" : "\"Space In Foldername\"",
		"concatenate_and_emit_output_file_path" : "\"Space In Foldername\"",

	Action:
		Build will fail. You have to remove the additional enclosing ""

	Why:
