v0.5.0
------

tldr: new configfile tsconfig.json. There will be a popup if you are affected.


- autocompletion and error view will use the Typescript head version,
  the unreleased Typescript 1.5 beta
- autocompletion and error view will now be initialized using tsconfig.json
- you need to create a tsconfig.json inside of your source folder
  or some parent folder. Example config:

{ "compilerOptions" : { "target" : "es5", "module" : "commonjs" } }

- refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig for more options.
- for now, you need to manage both configs in parallel, since the
  old config is still used for the build system.
- In the FOLLOWING releases, there will be another change which eliminates
  the need for root files and the old config structure.
