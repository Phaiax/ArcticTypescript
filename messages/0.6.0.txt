tl;dr:  required config file tsconfig.json. -> README


- many internal changes. Report issues @ github.

- Dropped: .sublimets config file, config in x.sublime-project

- Now:
    - Compiler related config -> tsconfig.json (REQUIRED)
        - linting of tsconfig.json
        - There is a WIZZARD if no tsconfig.json is found
   - Other config -> multiple allowed places. Refer to README!

- Compiler priority:
    1. Setting: tsc_path
    2. Search for typescript in your projects node_modules
    3. Use compiler supplied with ArcticTypescript (pre 1.5 (beta)) (should be fine)

- README rewrite

- PRO Users: take a look at filesGlob feature (-> README)
